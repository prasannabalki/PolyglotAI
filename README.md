## 🌍 Overview

**PolyglotAI** is an open-source initiative to build a **multimodal and multilingual Large Language Model**, starting from **Tamil** and extending to other **Indic** and **global languages**.  
It unifies **text, speech, and visual intelligence** to create a system that understands cultural nuance, linguistic diversity, and multimodal information.

Unlike generic multilingual models, **PolyglotAI** emphasizes *cultural, linguistic, and phonetic precision* — beginning with Tamil (தமிழ்) and expanding to Indian and global languages for cross-lingual understanding and digital inclusivity.

### 🔍 Why This Matters

Over **7,000 spoken languages** exist globally, yet AI largely favors English and a few major languages.  
**PolyglotAI** bridges this gap, creating an ecosystem where **Indic and global languages** coexist, interact, and learn from each other.

- **Education & Accessibility:** Voice-based multilingual tutors and translation tools.  
- **Healthcare & Governance:** Real-time multilingual assistants for hospitals and citizen services.  
- **Cultural Preservation:** OCR + AI restoration of ancient scripts and literature, including Tamil, Hebrew, and Sanskrit texts.  
- **Research & Innovation:** Open datasets and fine-tuning frameworks for cross-script and cross-cultural LLMs.  
- **Global Communication:** Seamless Tamil–Japanese, Hindi–Hebrew, or Telugu–French dialogue.

---

### 🧬 Key Innovations

- **Unified Multilingual Tokenizer:** Hybrid SentencePiece vocabulary across 10+ scripts, including right-to-left (Hebrew).  
- **Cross-Lingual Pretraining:** Semantic knowledge transfer among Tamil, Hindi, Hebrew, and Japanese corpora.  
- **SFT + DPO Alignment:** Politeness and tone adapted to each language’s cultural etiquette.  
- **Multilingual ASR & TTS:** Native-sounding speech for major Indic and global languages.  
- **Multiscript OCR Pipeline:** Universal recognition for Indic, Latin, and Semitic scripts.  
- **FAISS-Based RAG:** Knowledge retrieval from multilingual corpora (Indic + Global Wikipedia + Books).  
- **FastAPI + vLLM Serving:** Optimized for scalable, low-latency inference.

---

### 🌐 Vision

To create a **cross-cultural, cross-script AI ecosystem** that:
- Understands **semantics and tone** across 10 major languages.  
- Enables **real-time translation** and **multimodal understanding** between East and West.  
- Promotes **digital equality** across linguistic borders.  
- Acts as an **AI bridge** between Indic, European, and Semitic civilizations.
